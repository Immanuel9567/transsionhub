        <h1>How to Root your device!</h1>
        <div id="magiskrepo">
        <h2>Root Method: <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk" class="btn-ghost" target="_blank">Magisk</a></h2>
        </div>
        <h1>Why would i want Root?</h1>
        <p>Root is basically obtaining Super User Permission to do pretty much anything at all in your Android device. From system-level debloating to major UI modifications and so on. Rooting has perks, lots of them, but it also has it's downsides such as voiding your warranty, loss of safetynet and playintegrity and blocked access to banking applications. These problems do have workarounds.</p>
        <h1>Where do i start?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You will need a Compter</li>
            <li>You must have downloaded and extracted your Device firmware zip file.</li>
            <li>You must have unlocked your bootloader.</li>
            <li>DO NOT SKIP STEP 2 AND 3!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="center-text">Steps to Follow</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First off, download the latest stable magisk from the <a href="#magiskrepo" class="btn-ghost">Repository</a></li>
            <li>Now you will need the <a class="colored">boot.img</a> of your device which can be gotten inside your device firmware zip file.</li>
            <li>Also in your firmware is the <a class="colored">vbmeta.img</a> file which is REQUIRED to DISABLE VERITY and BOOT VERIFICATION!</li>
            <li>Put the <a class="colored">boot.img</a> file into your device and launch the Magisk application. <a class="colored">Note: The boot image must be patched in the device that it will be flashed into. e.g Patch Tecno Spark 7 boot.img with Tecno Spark 7 and flash it to Tecno SPark 7.</a></li>
            <li>Tap the "Install" button and select file for patching.</li>
            <li>Search for your .img file and click it.</li>
            <li>Once the patching process is complete, copy the file located in your Downloads Folder to your Computer along with the <a class="colored">vbmeta.img</a> located also in your firmware. This will be used to disable AVB (Android Verified Boot).</li>
            <li>On your computer, put both image files in a folder and open your terminal in that folder.</li>
            <li>Connect your device and run in terminal <a class="colored">adb reboot bootloader</a></li>
            <li>You must run the AVB disabling command before and after the boot image flashing command to avoid bootlooping</li>
            <li><div id="verity">run <a class="colored">fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta vbmeta.img</a> to disable AVB</a></li>
            <li>Now run <a class="colored">fastboot flash boot patchedboot.img</a></li>
            <li>Run the AVB command again and then, <a class="colored">fastboot reboot</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>With all that done, you should be booted with Magisk properly installed.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">I Flashed a magisk module and now device keeps rebooting, please help!</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">First of all, wait for the device to reboot, when the splash screen appears, wait 2 seconds and long-press vol-down until the device boots. This will boot the device to safemode disabling all 3rd party apps and all magisk modules, from here you can reboot back to system, open magisk and remove the problematic module and reboot once more.</div>
